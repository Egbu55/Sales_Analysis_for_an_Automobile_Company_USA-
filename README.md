#### DATA MODIFICATION

```python
# (1). Adding the following 3 columns to your pansdas Dataframe:  bikes_df



# TotalCostPrice : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x CostPrice_usd)


bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["CostPrice_usd"] 


# SalesRevenue : To be obtained by (OrderQuantity x SellingPrice_usd)


bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] = bikes_df["OrderQuantity"] * bikes_df["SellingPrice_usd"] 



# Profit : To be obtained by (SalesRevenue - TotalCostPrice)



bikes_df["Profit"] = bikes_df["SalesRevenue"] - bikes_df["TotalCostPrice"]


bikes_df.head()

```

## DATA ANALYSIS 

#### DATA FILTERING

```python
# filtering out only the data relevant to solving the problem statement.

Is_US= bikes_df["CustomerCountry"] == "United States"
Is_Bike= bikes_df["ProductCategory"]=="Bikes"
Bike_US= bikes_df[(Is_US)& (Is_Bike)]
Bike_US.head()
```

#### DATA AGGREGATION
```python
Bike_US.pivot_table(values= "Profit", index= "CustomerState", aggfunc= np.sum)
Total_profit_by_state =Bike_US.pivot_table(values= "Profit", index= "CustomerState", aggfunc= np.sum)
